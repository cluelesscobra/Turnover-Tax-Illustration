# Turnover-Tax-Illustration
The following notebooks are an illustration of the effects of security turnover on the after tax performance of an investment portfolio. The illustration is inspired by the 1993 paper published by Arnott and Jeffrey “Is Your Alpha Big Enough to Cover Its Taxes?”.

As an investment professional, I have found that advisors of taxable pools of capital don't fundamentally understand the potential tax drag of introducing active management to taxable public equity portfolios. While active management can have benefits of potentially enhancing risk adjusted returns through careful security selection and equal weighting of portfolio holdings, the chances of that manager beating a large cap equity benchmark is low, particularly after considering the drag that additional fees and tax can have on performance. Large cap indices beating a significant number of active managers before considering tax drag is perhaps a more recent phenomenon after the 2008 financial crisis, with some of the largest holdings in the index generating a large proportion of returns and making it structurally difficult for active managers with a position or sector concentration mandate to compete.
